## Predict Heart Disease

1. Get Dataset
Get the heart disease dataset from UCI Machine learning Repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
or https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

2. Change the name of CSV data file in your code

3. Install the libraries used on your PC
For example to install keras open command prompt on windows and run the following command
"pip install keras"

or open Anaconda prompt and run the following command
"conda install -c conda-forge keras"

4. Run the "Predic Heart Disease.py" file or copy the sections of the code into Jupyter Notebook and run each cell

5. Run each code cell sequentially.


## Arrhythmia (Abnormal Heartbeats) Classification

1. Download the dataset from https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/

2. Download and run the "Preprocessing.py" file by copying the contents in Jupyter Notebook

3. Adjust the paths to dataset in both files

4. Download and run the "CNN Train.py" file in jupyter notebook. Run different CNN models separately.


## Fever Prediction

1. Download the TempBeat.py file 
2. Download dataset Cleaveland.csv
3. Run the contents of pyyhon file in Jupyter Notebook.
